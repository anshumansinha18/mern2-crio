VERSION CONVENTION
-------------------

X.Y.Z: 
   1. X - major version
   2. Y - minor version
   3. Z - patches(bug fixes)

Eg: 4.18.2


PACKAGE.JSON
-------------


"dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }


Here,
  ^: means 4.18.x(largest of x). On doing npm install only patches with get installed.
  ~: means 4.x.x(largest of x). On doing npm install minor versions will also get installed.
   : If there is nothing, then it will give me exactly 4.18.2


INSTALLING DEV DEPENDENCIES
---------------------------

command: npm install nodemon --save-dev

Stored in package.json like this:
"devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.20"
  }

PACKAGE-LOCK.JSON
-----------------

Suppose package.json contains some dependency version as ~4.17.1. Now if someone does npm install in future then 4.18.2 will get installed due to the ~ present and due to this some properties might break. So, the package-lock.json will contain the exact version of the dependencies which was installed while building the project. 

command for installing package-lock.json version: 'npm ci' (not npm install)
